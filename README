Modified DBT-1 for Postgres-XC test and evaluation

This folder contains DBT-1 material to test and evaluate Postgres-XC.

The following modifications were made.

1. PostgreSQL interface was changed from ODBC to libpq.   It allows 
   much more workload to apply.

2. Added housekeeping feature of ORDER table.   Original DBT-1 did not 
   maintain old ORDER table.   So performance drop was observed when 
   the benchmark is done for a long period (days to weeks).   The main 
   reason is infinite growth of ORDER table.

3. Table design change.  Table design was changed to utilize Postgres-XC's 
   parallel execution feature and to avoid cross-node operations.   
   For details of the change, please refer to Postgres-XC's architecture 
   document.

The original DBT-1 repository will be found at

And the summary will be at

Postgres-XC development team appreciates Mr.Mark Wong who kindly approved 
to add this material to Postgres-XC releases.   We also appreciate if 
anybody take a look at these modifications and include some of them into 
the original DBT-1 repository.
